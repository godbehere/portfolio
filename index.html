					<div class='blurb' id='library-blurb' hidden='true'>
						<h1 style='font-size: 2.5em;'>Library</h1>
						<h1>About Project</h1>
						<p>This project is part of the cirriculum for The Odin Project.  The purpose was to exercise DOM manipulation as well as the use of objects, constructors, and classes in JavaScript.</p>
						<h1>What Went Well?</h1>
						<p>Adding transitions for the book cards was a good learning experience. I was able to experient with different options in CSS in order to achieve a "flipping open" effect</p>
						<h1>What Could Be Improved?</h1>
						<p>The modal window for adding new books is rough<br/>
						Books which are added are not stored in the local system or the cloud</p>
					</div>
					<div class='blurb' id='google-blurb' hidden='true'>
						<h1 style='font-size: 2.5em;'>Google Homepage</h1>
						<h1>About Project</h1>
						<p>The Google Homepage project was the first project assigned as part of The Odin Project. The purpose was to introduce Learners to HTML and CSS through copying the Google homepage visually.</p>
						<h1>What Went Well?</h1>
						<p>The page created looks very similar to the Google homepage</p>
						<h1>What Could Be Improved?</h1>
						<p>There is no footer on the page, and the search bar style does not quite match the one found on Google's homepage</p>
					</div>
					<div class='blurb' id='rps-blurb' hidden='true'>
						<h1 style='font-size: 2.5em;'>Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
						<h1>About Project</h1>
						<p>Assigned as part of the Odin Project's JavaScript fundamentals path, the Rock Paper Scissors project familiarized Learners with JavaScript functions, conditional statements, and logic flow</p>
						<h1>What Went Well?</h1>
						<p>I was able to implement a Rock Paper Sciccors game in the browser using animated buttons</p>
						<h1>What Could Be Improved?</h1>
						<p>There is currently no end to the game and the graphical interface could be improved</p>
					</div>
					<div class='blurb' id='etch-blurb' hidden='true'>
						<h1 style='font-size: 2.5em;'>Etch-A-Sketch</h1>
						<h1>About Project</h1>
						<p>Assigned as part of the Odin Project's JavaScript fundamentals path, the Etch-A-Sketch deals primarily with DOM manipulation.  The display is generated solely with JavaScript and its size can be adjusted by the user</p>
						<h1>What Went Well?</h1>
						<p>I am very pleased with the styling of this project.</p>
						<h1>What Could Be Improved?</h1>
						<p>Additional features would be nice. These could include customizing the colour options and adding more fluid options for adjusting grid size (perhaps a slider).</p>
					</div>
					<div class='blurb' id='calculator-blurb' hidden='true'>
						<h1 style='font-size: 2.5em;'>Calculator</h1>
						<h1>About Project</h1>
						<p>The calculator was the final assignment in the Odin Project JavaScript fundamentals path.  This project aimed to draw on skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  </p>
						<h1>What Went Well?</h1>
						<p>I was able to create a functional calculator application with a slick user interface</p>
						<h1>What Could Be Improved?</h1>
						<p>Not all of the buttons on the calculator are functional (parentheses and smiley face). Keyboard input is also not fully functional. There is no decimal input and although the calculator interface is pleasing, the rest of the page could use some styling.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='blurb' id='ion-blurb' hidden='true'>
						<h1 style='font-size: 2.5em;'>Ion Motion Simulator</h1>
						<h1>About Project</h1>
						<p>This python project was a personal project undertaken to further my knowledge related to mass spectrometry. The simulation program was suggested to me by a scientist who was providing training to me a Sciex.  Given a mass charge ratio as well as several other inputs, this application plots the path of an ion in the field of a set of quadrupole electrodes.</p>
						<h1>What Went Well?</h1>
						<p>With this project, stability of single ions in a quadrupole can be accurately predicted.  I was also able to add in the effect of a magnetic field on ions. I learned a lot while implementing the plotting of the ion path using matplotlib.</p>
						<h1>What Could Be Improved?</h1>
						<p>There is no GUI for the user. Inputs have to be hardcoded into the program prior to executing.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='blurb' id='elevator-blurb' hidden='true'>
						<h1 style='font-size: 2.5em;'>Elevator Quoting</h1>
						<h1>About Project</h1>
						<p>The Elevator Quoting program is an ongoing collaborative project.  This project was created in order to test concepts related to efficiently quoting complex mechanical systems. By filling out several simple forms, the user is provided with a cost as well as basic drawing in DXF format. The program is written in C# with the logic and saved quotes stored in a MySQL database.</p>
						<h1>What Went Well?</h1>
						<p>The DXF creation was a huge milestone for the team.</p>
						<h1>What Could Be Improved?</h1>
						<p>Conversion from imperial to metric units has been disabled currently due to bugs, and needs to be fixed still. More detailed cost breakdown should be included.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='blurb' id='landing-blurb' hidden='true'>
						<h1 style='font-size: 2.5em;'>Elevator Quoting</h1>
						<h1>About Project</h1>
						<p>This is a landing page that I made for my imaginary food blog "Adventures in Food".</p>
						<h1>What Went Well?</h1>
						<p>The polaroid style cards for the blog entries as well as the bookmark and favourite icons turned out well.</p>
						<h1>What Could Be Improved?</h1>
						<p>Overall style could be improved upon. Will require me to refine my CSS skills further</p>

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am a Junior Java Developer who recently transitioned from a career as a Mechanical Technologist/Designer. 
					With an ability to pick up skills quickly and rapidly grasp new concepts I know that I will quickly become and asset to any team.  
					In addition to the projects shared on this site, I have developed a web based logbook application for tracking Mass Spectrometer
					configuration using PHP and MySQL.</p>
				<p>Learning is one of my greatest passions, and I will always seek to better myself. I am also an amateur photographer, love to travel,
					rock climb, hike, and play a variety of console and PC games.</p>
